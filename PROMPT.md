Challenge: Model an Elevator

Create a simple React application that represents an Elevator.

Think about how an elevator will track what floor it’s on, where it needs to go, how it would receive new input, and how it will accept multiple users/floors at once.

A user should be able to view the current floor of the elevator at any given time. The elevator should take 1 second to move 1 floor.

The user should receive a message that the elevator is now at their desired floor. Feel free to use multiple views and components.

BONUS: It’s possible to have more than a single Elevator.

Writing tests is encouraged.

This is intentionally a fairly open-ended challenge.​ We’d like to see where your strengths are, as long as the project meets the requirements above. So feel free to add and configure as you’d like.

There is no time limit on this challenge -- we want you to be proud of what you turn in. Most people take a few days to a week to turn in something.

You can share the project with us by sharing your repo or a zip file. Please include instructions on how to install and run whatever you build.
